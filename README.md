Every Next Billion Fellow has the opportunity to share their story in at least two places (though we hope you'll share elsewhere, as well): *The Ethereum Foundation Blog*, and *The Next Billion Story Archive*.

##  Adding to the Story Archive

Every Next Billion Fellow has a folder in this repository that will display whatever information the fellow would like to present that relates to their story and activities during the duration of the Fellowship. 

The page is formatted in **[markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)**, which can display most commonly used text styles including headings, block quotes, and tables, as well as HTML styling. To begin with, story pages contain a one-paragraph description of the project that the Fellow applied with. 

Over the course of your fellowship and after its completion, you may want to add or amend the content. **You can change or update your page at any time** through a *pull request* on github. If you don't have a github account, make one! 

> The Next Billion website repository is located at **https://github.com/ethereum/nxbn-website**

### Submit a Pull Request

#### **Step One:** Find what you want to change. 

Fellowship stories are in the folder `public/content/fellowship/. 

All fellows have a unique folder in which their story lives as a markdown file titled `index.md`

For example, Mulenga's story is inside `public/content/fellowship/Mulenga/index.md`

#### **Step Two:** Add your changes as a new commit. 

The easiest way to change the content of `index.md` is to use the in-browser code editor that github provides.

> Github will ask you to **Fork the Repository**. Do so! Forking helps keep open-source contributions organized, so that everyone can have their own version of a codebase without affecting the work of others. You will use a *pull request* to *merge* your proposed changes with the main website *branch*. 

#### Step Three: Submit your Pull Request

Once your changes are saved on your *Fork*, you can submit them to the main website repository in the form of a *pull request*. 

The changes will be reviewed by a nxbn-website maintainer, and added to the next website update. 

> Before your change goes live, you will receive a **deploy preview** link to see what it looks like live on the website. You can make new changes if it doesn't look quite how you expected, or want to do something different.

## Website Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
