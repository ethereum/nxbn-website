            <p>
              The Ethereum Next Billion Fellowship Program is focused on
              identifying and supporting unique and talented individuals helping
              to demystify Ethereum's relevance and break down barriers to entry
              for people and communities not currently part of the Ethereum
              ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fellows will be part of a small forum for leaders who, during the
              course of six months, drive their own projects that address a
              particular enabler or blocker for Ethereum becoming a public good
              that acts as a foundational layer for other public goods.
            </p>
            <p>
              While there are some cohort-wide activities, it is a
              self-directed, self-driven program. Depending on the needs of each
              Fellow and their project, different support is provided, including
              financial support, PR opportunities, mentorship, technical advice,
              and access to the Ethereum Foundation network. Fellows’ work will
              be highlighted to showcase the impact and value of Ethereum and
              its community.

            <p>
              A Fellow candidate must have a project that is mutually
              cooperative with the Ethereum ecosystem. It doesn't have to
              directly integrate with Ethereum to qualify, but needs to be
              on-balance 'good' for the ecosystem and future Ethereum community.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project can be just an idea, in early stages, or already
              ongoing. It can be building an application, research, or an organizational 
              program/initiative. Whatever it is, the project must enable the 
              flourishing of regions, populations, or communities 
              that are underrepresented in the existing Ethereum
              ecosystem today.
