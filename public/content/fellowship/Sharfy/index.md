  ## Sharfy Adamantine

  **Sharfy Adamantine** (X: @sharfyae) enables environmental stewardship by connecting climate finance directly to local conservation efforts and data at [Gainforest](https://gainforest.earth/). By improving compatibility and functionality of the Hypercerts standard, ecosystem protection can become more economically viable for organizations and conservation communities of all shapes, sizes, and contexts.

  Sharfy's work focuses on creating direct financial pathways between funding sources and on-the-ground conservation efforts. Through advancements in the Hypercerts standard, the project aims to make environmental protection more accessible and economically sustainable for diverse conservation communities worldwide.
