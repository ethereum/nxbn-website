## Tomislav Mamić

Tomislav or “Tomo,” from Croatia, is working on the Municipal Quadratic Funding Initiative ([MUQA](https://muqa.org/)) - a pilot that aims to assist cities in using QV and QF mechanisms to allocate funding for public projects in Croatia. Apart from the fundraising, he seeks to introduce transparency, efficiency, and citizen participation in managing resources for public goods.
