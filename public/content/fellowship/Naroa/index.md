  ## **Naroa Zurutuza**

  **Naroa Zurutuza** [(Giga)](https://gigaconnect.org/) explored Ethereum-based solutions as part of Giga's effort to connect every school to the internet. By helping to provide today's most important public good to billions of currently unconnected people, Naroa envisioned many roles that blockchain can play, from increasing accountability of service providers and financing connectivity infrastructures to an access point to the global economy and marketplaces.
