## Lefteris Arapakis

Lefteris was born into a family with a deep-rooted tradition in the fishing industry. In 2016, he founded Enaleia to engage fishers in addressing the social and environmental challenges of ocean degradation.
Lefteris began by educating fishers on sustainable practices and integrating collected waste into a circular economy, focusing on the plastics value chain in Greece. His initiative quickly expanded to encompass the entire Mediterranean Sea. A key aspect of Enaleia's work is tracking the lifecycle of ocean-collected plastic, and as part of his Fellowship, Lefteris will transition the platform into a public chain and explore other blockchain-related verticals into Eneleia.
