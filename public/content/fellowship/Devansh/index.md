# Devansh's story

Devansh Mehta, co-founder of [VoiceDeck](https://voicedeck.org/), is interested in mapping out public good impact space. Impact methodologies and markets for environmental use cases are well-documented mechanisms, but sometimes ‘impact’ wanders into more subjective territory: Investigative journalism, for example, is undoubtedly a public good. How can the real work of journalists be documented and valued in a way that fits into the right funding mechanism? Devansh will work with citizen journalism newsrooms to explore methodologies of impact documentation using the [hypercerts standard,](https://hypercerts.org/) with an aim to find a good mechanism of retroactive funding for positive social outcomes.
