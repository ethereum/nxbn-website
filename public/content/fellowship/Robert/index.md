  ## Robert Cowlishaw

  **Robert Cowlishaw** (LinkedIn: robert-cowlishaw) is an aerospace engineer pioneering research at the intersection of zero-knowledge proofs, trusted execution, and satellite imagery. He is developing a prototype app that automatically and verifiably triggers emergency response systems after natural disasters. His work includes collaboration with the European Space Agency to activate satellites for monitoring affected areas across political and systemic boundaries.

  Based in Glasgow, UK, Robert is combining advanced cryptographic techniques with satellite technologies to create systems that can respond to emergencies with speed and reliability. His research aims to overcome jurisdictional barriers that often slow down disaster response by creating verifiable and trustworthy systems that can operate across different political landscapes.
