## David Uzochukwu
Running an Ethereum node in Africa faces challenges such as limited internet connectivity, high data costs, inconsistent power supply, and lack of education, all of which can hinder consistent operation. However, it presents significant opportunities for local innovation, improved financial inclusion, and participation in the global blockchain ecosystem, particularly as infrastructure continues to improve. David will be researching and documenting what it takes for Ethereum to be a decentralized world computer where everyone, independently of their location, can play a role in ensuring its geographical spread and robustness.
