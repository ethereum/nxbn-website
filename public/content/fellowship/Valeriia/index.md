## Valeriia Panina

Valeriia is a user experience specialist and an advisor to the Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation. The war in Ukraine has shown that ingenuity and tenacity in human coordination is essential. When understanding the potential of protocols like Ethereum to be useful in such a time, pragmatism is wise. During her Fellowship, Ria will research the real drivers and blockers of adoption of cryptocurrencies and other decentralized applications for ordinary users to map emergent use cases and behaviors in Ukraine.

How Ukrainians are adopting blockchain

Ukraine has ranked as one of the countries with the highest crypto adoption (3rd in 2022, 4th in 2021) on Chainalysisâ€™s Global Crypto Adoption Index. The general perception is that since the full-scale war broke out, crypto adoption has been on rise, with [government agencies and other organizations facilitating donations in crypto](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/03/09/ukraine-has-received-close-to-100-million-in-crypto-donations/), [UNHCR sending crypto to displaced people](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ukraine-crypto-refugee-aid), and [a major pharmacy chain accepting crypto payments](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/ukrainian-pharmacy-chain-enables-bitcoin-payments) Does this perception matches the reality of adoption by Ukrainians, be it the general population, founders, educators, government agencies and civil society?

Valeriia's research seeks to understand the underlying factors and experiences driving this trend among Ukrainian citizens. It explores how ordinary Ukrainians are using cryptocurrencies and other decentralized technologies, assessing their impact and identifying opportunities for broader application. Further to her research, Valeriia is developing a framework that could guide similar adoption strategies worldwide, by documenting and analyzing the challenges and benefits encountered by users in Ukraine. This comprehensive study combines online research with in-depth interviews and surveys, aiming to produce actionable insights and a scalable model for assessing cryptocurrency adoption in diverse geopolitical contexts.
