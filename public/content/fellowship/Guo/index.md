  ## Guo

  Guo Liu's project combines advertisement protocols and quadratic funding on [Matters Town](https://matters.town/) to support high-quality open-access content. By using advertisement revenue as a matching fund, the project aims to democratize support for content creators, drawing on Guo's experience in building decentralized digital public spaces and his commitment to freedom of information. MattersTown is widely used by content creators around the world (predominance of Chinese-speaking, Russian, and Korean). It is experimenting with a new way to fund journalism and content creation.

## Billboard Protocol

Billboard "protocol" is simply NFTs used as billboards on websites, applications, or even physical spaces. They are traded with Harberger Tax, which puts them on continuous auctions. Advertisers or advertiser agencies bid and use billboards for advertisements, while the tax becomes revenue for the author or community that create the space.
