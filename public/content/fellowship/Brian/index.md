# The Big Narrative

Brian's story is about learning what workers in today's world need. 

Particularly in Indonesia, the real world needs of a modern worker are not served by the traditional financial products. Individuals and businesses need credit that can meet them where they are. 

Web3 is more than financial products, but these are important tools of development. 


## The small story
Copra built an NFT-based personal loan product that has some flaws, but at least it scopes out what lending on-chain might look like for someone who invoices a salary using a web3 tool. 



## Introduction

Iâ€™m building [Copra](/), a DeFi lending protocol that facilitates on-chain credit to entities with on-chain revenues and income. Today, the reality is that most who earn in crypto are still those institutions and individuals within the crypto space, and in the short-term Copra will be focusing on those audiences. However, that is still very far from the full potential and the full mission of the project. As DeFi will be the new financial system of the world, crypto will be the new payment medium in the real economy including to receive income and revenue among individuals and businesses. This will be the unlock for Copra ultimate mission, which is to provide financially-underserved individuals and businesses in the real economy, particularly in emerging countries, with the credit that they deserve.

Many financial institutions, big and small, new and old, had attempted to serve the financially underserved in the region only to fall short. Large traditional financial institutions have thick bureaucracy and outdated operational systems that ultimately limit innovations and damper speed of execution. Some emerging fintech lending companies that pledged to fight loan sharks effectively became loan sharks themselves by imposing predatory interest rates and unethical debt collection processes. There is only so much the current centralised financial systems with its technology limitations can do to truly bring financial inclusion to the billions of financially underserved people all around the globe.

Although the mission to bring credit access to emerging market borrowers through DeFi-sourced capital that is cheaper in cost is commendable, some of those protocols' practical implementations in reality have proven to be problematic. Given those credit protocols are unable to reach the end borrowers directly, they are forced to partner with off-chain centralised financing companies to distribute the lending capital to the end borrowers. Inevitably, some centralised trust is being put on the financing company partners and unfortunately there is no guarantee that those partners are behaving in good faith, particularly those operating in developing nations. Many reporting or auditing could be done to hopefully increase transparency, but given that inherently those financing company partners are off-chain entities, there is no verifiable transparency like in smart contract codes. As a result, in many occurrences, the benefit of lower cost of lending capital from DeFi are not delivered to the end borrowers as their interest rates are still astronomically high because all the extra margins are absorbed by the financing company partners themselves. Even worse, fraud by the financing company partners could and did happen that resulted in broad negative impact. There is no doubt that there is immense opportunity in channelling the capital in DeFi into billions of underserved borrowers in emerging markets, but finding the correct model and executing it properly have been proven to be key.
