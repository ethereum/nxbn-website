# Workers on-chain 


## Introduction

Iâ€™m building [Copra](), a DeFi lending protocol that facilitates on-chain credit to entities with on-chain revenues and income. Today, the reality is that most who earn in crypto are still those institutions and individuals within the crypto space, and in the short-term Copra will be focusing on those audiences. However, that is still very far from the full potential and the full mission of the project. As DeFi will be the new financial system of the world, crypto will be the new payment medium in the real economy including to receive income and revenue among individuals and businesses. This will be the unlock for Copra ultimate mission, which is to provide financially-underserved individuals and businesses in the real economy, particularly in emerging countries, with the credit that they deserve.

Many financial institutions, big and small, new and old, had attempted to serve the financially underserved in the region only to fall short. Large traditional financial institutions have thick bureaucracy and outdated operational systems that ultimately limit innovations and damper speed of execution. Some emerging fintech lending companies that pledged to fight loan sharks effectively became loan sharks themselves by imposing predatory interest rates and unethical debt collection processes. There is only so much the current centralised financial systems with its technology limitations can do to truly bring financial inclusion to the billions of financially underserved people all around the globe.
