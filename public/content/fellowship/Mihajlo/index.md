## **Mihajlo Atanackovic**

**Mihajlo Atanackovic** is leading the digital transformation journey of one of the world's biggest non-formal educational youth movements - the [World Organization of the Scout Movement](https://www.scout.org/) with 57+ million members from around the globe. To get the Scout Movement ready for web3, he is embarking on an ambitious project involving digitalising badges, exploring DAOs for different levels of the Movement, and how the scouts might employ novel coordination mechanisms for grassroots organization.

The Scouting movement is decentralised, with each chapter bringing its own unique skills and goals to a grassroots community focused on fostering an environment of learning, personal growth, and mutual respect. Scouts follow a general framework and guiding principles agreed upon by all members of the World Organization, but have autonomy in how they implement projects and initiatives.

In Scouting, we believe that education is key to making the world a better place to live, and that technology is one of the most powerful tools for education. Since 1957, scouts around the world have participated in the “Jamboree on the air” – a remote gathering of scouts working on the skills of amateur radio operation. More recently, scouts around the world have joined the “[Jamboree on the Internet](https://www.jotajoti.info/)” – the next generation of global scouting events facilitated by technology.

## ScoutPass

Although this journey began with seeing the untapped potential of NFTs and digital badges, the world of Web 3.0 is a big territory -- and I wanted to chart a path that moves wisely toward the long-term goals of Scouting. A Scout's badges are tokens of personal growth and achievement that a scout takes with them. They help to support and define the identity of a scout, acting as 'soul-bound tokens' attached to a real person's journey through life and scouting. Digital badges are a large part of the picture, but what we really need is an _identity system_ that is compatible with digital badges, tokens, and anything else that Scouts may need in the future.

We are now preparing to build the first foundational layer of World Scouting Web3 vision: The Scout’s Passport. As an identity system, a Scout’s passport would be compatible with all sorts of Web3 systems, and would allow the scouting movement to have an identity layer for badges, tokens, signatures, messages, etc. In particular, a Web3-enabled scout’s identity would allow for more robust social recovery for scouts, allowing us to safely create DAO scouting groups, to explore new methods of crowdfunding and governance, and of course to unlock the infinite possibilities of NFTs and digital badges or certifications. Above all else, developing a special wallet module for the Scouts will enable us to create user flows and account protections specifically for young people, an important demographic not often considered in consumer wallet software.
