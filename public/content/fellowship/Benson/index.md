# Benson

**Benson Njuguna** [(Acre Africa)](https://acreafrica.com/) worked to implement blockchain solutions to a microinsurance product that protects thousands of small-scale farmers in Kenya from extreme weather events. His project tested and showcased Ethereum’s potential in enabling the viability and sustainability of products and services that target the bottom of the wealth pyramid. [Read more about Benson's work here.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/12/07/fellows-spotlight-on-kenya/)

In Sub-Saharan Africa, only 3% of 48 million smallholder farmers are [insured](https://www.raflearning.org/sites/default/files/sep_2018_isf_syngneta_insurance_report_final.pdf?token=1i4u5GwD). Owning 1 acre of land and earning approximately $1.40 per person per day characterize a [smallholder farmer](http://www.fao.org/3/i5251e/i5251e.pdf). Smallholder farmers often own a mixture of cash crops and subsistence or non-commercial farming; and, they lack the financial and technological resources of large-scale industrial farms. As extreme weather events become ever more frequent due to climate change, one flood or drought can push such farmers into the spiraling cycle of poverty without protection by means of crop insurance.
