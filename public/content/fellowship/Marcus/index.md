## Marcus Alburez Myers
**Marcus Alburez Myers** is a Guatemalan entrepreneur working to address today's pressing challenges. He is currently a Founder-in-Residence at Europe's leading accelerator, Entrepreneur First, where he is drawing on the power of web3 to empower marginalized communities. With a focus in Guatemala, Marcus explored the real-world barriers to physical asset financing for DeFi, and compiled his finding into the ["Last Mile DeFi Report"](https://marcus.mirror.xyz/nFmYxl7DkZF655eCFz7Z4QlrOZ5ycg7Ny5gDcMpQ-tQ).

Among many things, crypto's promise is to create new, more equitable economic models that can benefit everyone, not just the wealthy and powerful. Some see DeFi’s promise as being able to provide financial services to those who may not have access to traditional financial instruments in emerging economies around the world, including some of the world’s most disenfranchised communities.

If you're reading this, chances are that you're optimistic about the potential of technology to address some of these problems. Maybe that means decentralized networks that **fundamentally revolutionize** the way we interact with ourselves, each other, and systems of power. Or maybe it simply means apps that use new and more accurate types of digital information to assess someone's creditworthiness so they can get a decent interest rate on a small loan. I think the reality will be somewhere in-between.

I have spent the last few months actively exploring ways to break down this barrier of financial empowerment by leveraging the power of Ethereum. My goal is to research a number of viable solutions powered by cryptographic technologies for financial inclusion and access to credit to ultimately enable human flourishing across Guatemala and beyond.

I have been researching which money legos might be useful in a place like Puntarenas and throughout the rest of Guatemala. In particular, I have been exploring the barriers to adoption and potential solutions that could be used to unlock peer-to-peer lending for those without access to more equitable financial mechanisms.

To date, as a part of my research I have spoken with members of hundreds of crypto projects including those leading DeFi protocols, DAOs, identity and scaling solutions, and other core developers, designers, wallet builders. Additionally, I've held conversations and interviews with local leading projects, government offices, and international NGOs throughout Guatemala and other emerging economies to understand where they may see crypto acting as a catalyst for new means of coordination and equitable financial services.

This research has been incredibly insightful and has allowed me to gain a better understanding of the current state of DeFi and the wider crypto ecosystem’s potential in emerging economies.
