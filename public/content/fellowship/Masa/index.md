## Masahiro Fukuhara

Masahiro (Masa) Fukuhara wants to spread the spirit of ONGAESHI, (恩返し, "To return a favor") in the world of education. [ONGAESHI DAO](https://www.lp.ongaeshi-pj.jp/en) is exploring mechanisms of retroactive solidarity payments in education and employment. For his Fellowship, Masa and other ONGAESHI DAO team members will learn from pilot programs in which contributors to the public good of education like funders and teachers are rewarded when businesses hire their students.
