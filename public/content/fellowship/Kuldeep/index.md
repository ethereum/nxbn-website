# Kuldeep Bandhu Aryal

**Kuldeep Bandhu Aryal** [(BRAC)](http://www.brac.net/) sought to build a blockchain and crypto strategy for BRAC - the world’s largest NGO based in Bangladesh that annually serves over 100 million people. His project - which also involves multiple experiments using blockchain - could serve as a model for other social enterprises and the development sector at large.
