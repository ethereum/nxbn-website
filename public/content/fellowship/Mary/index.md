## Mary Davies

**Mary Davies** is a legal researcher and technologist based in the Cayman Islands. Mary has been exploring a pressing question: If life-extension technology doesn’t pan out over the next few decades, what happens to your crypto when you die? Currently there is no trustless or decentralized solution to this question, and this presents a problem. Mary’s fellowship explored what new cryptographic mechanisms might enable us to trustlessly transfer assets after death, in a way that is legally compliant.
